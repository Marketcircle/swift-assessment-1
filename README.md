# SwiftUI Technical Assessment

## Prerequisites

- Read the **README** fully.
- You will create this application using the latest Xcode.

## The Main Objectives

Using the sample data provided, create a simple **all Swift UI** app that does the following:

- Imports the data using `Codable` (see data.json in the assets folder).
- Display the names the left sidebar (which collapses in compact mode).
- When selecting a name on the sidebar, you should display the details in the main view on the right.
- Add at least 1 unit test. While you are not required to store and create the objects, you need to demonstrate that you understand and can do unit tests. The more test coverage, the better (see bonus tasks).
- SwiftUI previews must be functional.
- The application must compile and run.
- Update your readme with some instructions on how to compile and run the application.
- Sensibly document your code.

## Bonus (Optional) Tasks

- Allow for the creation of objects using a simple UI.
- Requires that `name` and `email` cannot be blank.
- Provide storage of the data using SwiftData.

Your models should look something like this:

## Considerations / Recommendations

- This is your opportunity to show what you can bring to our engineering team.
- Write clean, reusable, readable code.
- You only need 1 test, but those that have more coverage will be ranked more favorably.
